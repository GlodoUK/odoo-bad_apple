# Everything In Odoo: Bad Odoo Edition

[Can Odoo play "Bad Apple"? (And what it teaches us about ERP customisation & upgrades)](https://www.glo.systems/blog/blog-news-1/can-odoo-play-bad-apple-and-what-it-teaches-us-about-erp-customisation-upgrades-625)

> There is an unwritten rule on the internet: If a device has a screen, someone, somewhere, must figure out how to make it play the famous "Bad Apple" shadow art video. Or play Doom. From graphing calculators to oscilloscopes, it’s the ultimate "Hello World" for creative developers.
> So obviously, we needed to make this happen in Odoo. The result? Well, see for yourself.
> ...
>  Wait, isn't that just a video player? 
> Not exactly. If we had just embedded a YouTube link inside an Odoo dashboard, that would be cheating (and boring).
> What you are seeing above is Odoo pre-processing the video, and then using Javascript to render it using some custom Odoo UI elements, and the standard Javascript Audio API, at a smooth 24fps. We probably could've gone faster, but this is an out of hours joke that got out of hand. We have to draw the line somewhere. We originally wanted to reuse one of the existing UI elements (either the Kanban or the Cohort view), but the issue we ran into was just "not enough pixels"!
